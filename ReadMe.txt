Image Analysis:

To read-write images software available had used, e.g., the OpenCV. Other operations was programmed.

Tasks:
1. Box Filter : The first version is by definition, the second one as run filter. The output is two resulting images and two execution times to compare. Parameter: filter size (odd).

2. Prewitt edge detector: gradient filter Ã©s nonmaxima-suppression (NMS). Output is two images: 1. gradient magnitute; 2. final result after NMS.

3. Thresholding algorithm by Otsu: Output: thresholded image and the obtained threshold value.

4. Skeletonization: Output: skeleton image.
